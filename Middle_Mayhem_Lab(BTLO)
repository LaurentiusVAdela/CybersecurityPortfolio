# 🕵️ Middle Mayhem Lab (BTLO)  

## 📌 Scenario  
The SOC team at **MiddleMayhem Inc.** detected unusual network traffic directed at their admin portal. No confirmed breaches were initially observed.  
I was tasked with analyzing **SIEM logs in Splunk Enterprise** to identify how attackers:  
- Bypassed authentication  
- Gained remote code execution  
- Moved laterally through the network
